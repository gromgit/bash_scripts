# bash_scripts
My collection of bash scripts, including:

* `dateh`: `date` for humans
  * does everything `date` can do, and adds relative date output like "last Monday" and "2 years' time"
  * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: `dateh` has "graduated" to [its own repo](https://github.com/gromgit/dateh). The local script just prints a message directing you there, and will be removed entirely at some point in the future.
* `youtube_rss_url`: discover YouTube RSS feed URLs
  * converts YouTube URLs into corresponding URLs for your RSS feed reader

Run `script_name -h` for documentation.
